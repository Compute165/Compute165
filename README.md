**Hello! i m Compute165!**

I am interested in learning Python because it is an amazing language
and i sometimes use it to make Discord bots and self-bots

You can also hire me to make a custom Python discord self bot for you!
I am mainly in Discord (obvi) so you can friend me!

**Discord:- IronDemiGod#1610**

I am mostly online there

The repositories with HTML code i made for my coding classes but you can ignore it ðŸ˜ƒ
